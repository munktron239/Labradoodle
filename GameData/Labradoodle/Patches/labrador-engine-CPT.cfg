// Add support for Community Parts Titles
// In CPT, the 'Poodle' is labeled as 'RE-B10' instead of its stock name 'RE-L10', so the naming order gets messed up when used with CPT
// This patch adds consistency to the 'Labrador' when CPT is installed

@PART[labrador-engine]:NEEDS[002_CommunityPartsTitles]:FINAL  { @title = #LOC_Labradoodle_labrador-engine_title-CPT } // RE-B20 "Labrador" Liquid Fuel Engine
